#  My Dad's model railway stuff
## About
My beloved dad left behind a lot of model railway hobby kits and pieces when he died. There are pictures below.

We would love for someone else to enjoy them on his behalf. And if we get back space in the shed, then we won't complain.
* Everything is **OO-grade**.
* It's all **free** to a good home, but with **two conditions**:
  1. You [**make a donation to Rennie Grove Peace Hospice**](https://secure.renniegrovepeace.org/page/171804/donate/1), instead of paying us.<br>
_(The hospice was wonderful to my dad when he needed them, so please be as generous as you can be with any donation.)_
  2. You **don't sell** anything we give you. <br>_(We're don't want anyone, including us, to profit off of Dad's death.)_
* Everything is offered in an **as-shown condition**&nbsp;&ndash; but, as you'll see, many kits are unopened.

You should have my contact information already, so please let me know if you'd like any further information. I'll do what I can.

Thanks very much

&mdash;Joe
